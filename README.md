## One Platform to share It All
# Hi! I'm Sofia, and I really care about the environment. We are struggling in a world that insists on promoting consumption above all things damaging the environment drastically.

# Consuming is not a problem, but we need to do it responsibly, right? Why do we need to buy a Grill to do a barbecue if someone near the park you go to has one and can share it with you? Let's share!

# With "Share it All," you can see what people are sharing, a wedding dress, a grill, a bike, a jacket. Let them know that you will need the object, and set a date to pick up and a date to return the object. That is it. Near the park, where you often do a barbecue, have homes with grills all over.

# You can charge someone if you want or let them use your stuff for free. If you let one use it for free, you can set some taxes to be paid in case of damage.

# Let's share things? Let's implement this?

    # Users must be able to post the desire to borrow some good
        Sometimes, the desired good is not available. To encourage people to lend them, a user must be able to tell people that he needs a good.
        There must be in the system a list of desired goods. `

## Additional Features

     # Maintainance Costs
        Associate a maintenance cost to the goods
        The user does not set maintenance costs. It is calculated as the average of the maintenance costs informed by all the users for a specific good.
            e.g., A grill maintenance cost is calculated by summing up €10 reported by Joe, €8 reported by Jack, €15 reported by John. The app will then calculate the community maintenance cost for the Grill.
     # Borrowing multiple units.
        User must be able to borrow multiple units of a specific good. Sometimes we need more than one of a particular good, and the system must allow the user to borrow a batch of goods even if they belong to different owners.
